# Quiz Game
This is a simple multiple choice style quiz game intended to test a user's knowledge of Simpsons trivia.  Players have a limited amount of time to answer a series of questions, after which they will receive a score/rating based on the number of correct responses provided during quiz.  If a player sets a new high score, they will be notified and asked to enter their name which is then inserted into the high score list in the appropriate position.
